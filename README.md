# biofiletypes

_in development_

List of biological file types and their definitions.

## Contributing

1. Fork this repository, clone your fork, and edit [data/biofiletypes.csv](data/biofiletypes.csv). 
2. If you're using Excel, make sure to remove the silly MS line endings (e.g., use something like `tr '\r' '\n'`).
3. Test that the new file works locally by running this handy python command: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` and navigating to <http://localhost:8000/>.
4. Commit and push those changes to your fork and submit a pull request.
