fasta; fa,"FASTA. FASTA format is a text-based format for representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. The format also allows for sequence names and comments to precede the sequences.",<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format' target='_blank'>Wikipedia article on FASTA</a>,"Generic format used by sequence aligners, assemblers, etc."
fastq; fq,FASTQ. Reads from a sequencing instrument. Each read is represented by a group of four lines in a text file. Line 1 is the read name; line 2 is the nucleotide sequence; line 3 is usually blank or a repeat of line 1; line 4 is the quality score.,<a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format' target='_blank'>Wikipedia article on FASTQ</a>,"Generic format used by sequence aligners, assemblers, etc."

bed,Browser Extensible Data.

bedgraph,"The BedGraph format allows display of continuous-valued data in track format. This display type is useful for probability scores and transcriptome data.  This track type is similar to the wiggle (WIG) format, but unlike the wiggle format, data exported in the bedGraph format are preserved in their original state.

bigbed,"The bigBed format stores annotation items that can either be simple, or a linked collection of exons, much as BED files do. BigBed files are created initially from BED type files, using the program bedToBigBed. The resulting bigBed files are in an indexed binary format. The main advantage of the bigBed files is that only the portions of the files needed to display a particular region are transferred to UCSC, so for large data sets bigBed is considerably faster than regular BED files. The bigBed file remains on your web accessible server (http, https, or ftp), not on the UCSC server.

bigwig,"The bigWig format is for display of dense, continuous data that will be displayed as a graph. BigWig files are created initially from WIG type files, using the UCSC program wigToBigWig. Alternatively, bigWig files can be created from bedGraph files, using the UCSC program bedGraphToBigWig. In either case, the resulting bigWig files are in an indexed binary format.",<a href='http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/help/bigWig.html' target='_blank'>UCSC</a>,genome browsers
gtf; gff,"Annotates genomic features. The GFF (General Feature Format) format consists of one line per feature, each containing 9 columns of data, plus optional track definition lines.
